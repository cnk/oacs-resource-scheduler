ad_page_contract {
  This is the highest level site specific master template.
  site-master adds site wide OpenACS functionality to every page.

  You should NOT need to modify this file unless you are adding functionality
  for a site wide service.

  If you want to customise the look and feel of your site you probably want to
  modify /www/default-master.

  Note: currently site wide service content is hard coded in this file.  At 
  some point we will want to determine this content dynamically which will 
  change the content of this file significantly.
