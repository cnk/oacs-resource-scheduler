This html page will be displayed instead of the standard OpenACS error message
if there is a database failure. Customize at your will, and don't forget to
update the contact address below!

When you are finished customizing it you need to enable it by renaming
it from 'www/global/site-failure.html.disabled' to
'www/global/site-failure.html'.

Note that some broken IE browsers might show a 'friendly' error
message instead if this file does not exceed 500 bytes.
