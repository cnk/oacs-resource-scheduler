    Implementation of the interface acs_mail_lite::incoming_email for acs-mail-lite. This proc
    takes care of emails bounced back from mailer deamons. The required syntax for the To header
    is as follows: EnvelopPrefix-user_id-signature-package_id@myhost.com. This email was set for
    the Return-Path header of the original email. The signature is created by calculating the SHA
    value of the original Message-Id header. Thus an email is valid if the signature is correct and
    the user is known. If this is the case we record the bounce.
