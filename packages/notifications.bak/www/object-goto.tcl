# added type_id parameter to redirect to the correct page for an object
# we need the implementation name which is not the same as the object_type

# look in tcl/delivery-procs.tcl, there is a get_impl_key proc that 
# queries the acs_sc_impls table for the implementation name
# but the query is delivery_type specific, so we can't use it here
