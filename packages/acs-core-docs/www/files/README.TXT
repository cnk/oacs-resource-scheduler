ALL the files in this directory are *generated*. Do not edit them. Instead,
edit the files in /packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/files/ and
then run 'make' from /packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml

It's done this way so that everything under
/packages/acs-core-docs/www/xml/ is a self-contained version of the most
up-to-date docs, able to regenerate the latest HTML and files.

Bottom line, if you want to edit docs, make sure you're editing files
underneath the 'xml' directory.
