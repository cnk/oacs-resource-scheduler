      Rules for Committing Code to the OpenACS repository
    </h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      CVS commit procedures are governed by 
      <a href="http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=185506" target="_top">
        TIP (Technical Improvement Proposal) #61: Guidelines for CVS committers
      </a>
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
          Which branch?
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              For core packages, new features should always be
              committed on HEAD, not to release branches.
            </p></li><li><p>
              For core packages, bug fixes should be committed on the
              current release branch whenever applicable.
            </p></li><li><p>
              For non-core packages, developers should work on a
              checkout of the release branch of the lastest release. For example,
              if OpenACS 5.1.0 is released, developers should work on the
              oacs-5-1 branch. When oacs-5-2 is branched, developers should
              continue working on oacs-5-1 until OpenACS 5.2.0 is actually
              released.
            </p></li><li><p>
              The current release branch is merged back to HEAD after
              each dot release.
            </p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>
          New packages should be created in the 
          <tt class="computeroutput">
            /packages
          </tt>
          directory
          and the maturity flag in the .info file should be zero. This is a change from
          previous policy, where new packages went to /contrib/packages)
        </p></li><li><p>
          Code
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              Only GPL code and material should be committed to the
              OpenACS CVS repository (cvs.openacs.org)
            </p></li><li><p>
              Code should only be reformatted when functionality is
              changed, e.g. when you change control flow and reindent to reflect
              it.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Database upgrade scripts should only span one release
              increment, and should follow
              <a href="http://openacs.org/doc/current/eng-standards-versioning.html#naming-upgrade-scripts" target="_top">
                Naming Database Upgrade Scripts
              </a>
              .
            </p></li><li><p>
              Database upgrade scripts should never go to the release
              version, e.g., should always have a letter suffix such as d1 or
              b1.
            </p></li><li><p>
              CVS commit messages should be intelligible in the context
              of Changelogs. They should not refer to the files or
              versions.
            </p></li><li><p>
              CVS commit messages and code comments should refer to
              bug, tip, or patch number if appropriate, in the format &quot;resolves
              bug 11&quot;, &quot;resolves bugs 11, resolves bug 22&quot;. &quot;implements tip 42&quot;,
              &quot;implements tip 42, implements tip 50&quot;, &quot;applies patch 456 by User
              Name&quot;, &quot;applies patch 456 by User Name, applies patch 523 by
              ...&quot;.
            </p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>

                more information

              ).  A proposed change must be approved by TIP if:
            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              It changes the core data model, or
            </p></li><li><p>
              It will change the behavior of any core package in a way

          A proposed change need not be TIPped if:
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              it adds a new function to a core package in a way that:
            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
                  does not change the backwards-compatibility of public API
                  functions.
                </p></li><li><p>
                  does not change the data model

                </p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>
              it changes private API, or
            </p></li><li><p>
              it is a change to a non-core, non-standard package
            </p></li></ol></div></li></ol></div></li><li><p>
          Tags
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              When a package is released in final form, the developer
              shall tag it &quot;packagename-x-y-z-final&quot; and &quot;openacs-x-y-compat&quot;. x-y
              should correspond to the current branch. If the package is
              compatible with several different core versions, several compat
              tags should be applied.
            </p></li><li><p>
              When OpenACS core is released, the openacs-x-y-z-final
              tag shall be applied to all compat packages.
            </p></li></ol></div><p>
          For example, adding a new API function wouldn't require a
          TIP. Changing an existing API function by adding an optional new
          flag which defaults to no-effect wouldn't require a TIP. Added a
          new mandatory flag to an existing function would require a
          TIP.
        </p></li></ol></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2874031"></a>
        Reasons
      </h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        We don't currently have clear standards for committing
        code.
      </p><p>
        Rule 1.3: First, this ensures that developers are working
        against stable core code. Second, it ensures that new package
        releases are available to OpenACS users immediately.
      </p><p>
        Rule 3.4: If an upgrade script ends with the final release
        number, then if a problem is found in a release candidate it cannot
        be addressed with another upgrade script. E.g., the last planned
        upgrade script for a package previously in dev 1 would be
        upgrade-2.0.0d1-2.0.0b1.sql, not upgrade-2.0.0d1-2.0.0.sql. Note
        that using rc1 instead of b1 would be nice, because that's the
        convention with release codes in cvs, but the package manager
        doesn't support rc tags.
      </p><p>
        Rule 5.1: Reason 1: The packagename tag is a permanent,
        static tag that allows for future comparison. The compat tag is a
        floating tag which is used by the repository generator to determine
        the most recent released version of each package for each core
        version. This allows package developers to publish their releases
        to all users of automatic upgrade without any intervention from the
        OpenACS release team.Reason 2: The compat tags allows CVS users to
        identify packages which have been released since the last core
        release.Reason 3: The compat tag or something similar is required
        to make Rule 6 possible.
      </p><p>
        Rule 5.2: This allows OpenACS developers who are creating
        extensively customized sites to branch from a tag which is stable,
        corresponds to released code instead of development code, and
        applies to all packages. This tag can be used to fork packages as
        needed, and provides a common ancestor between the fork and the
        OpenACS code so that patches can be generated.

      Informal Guidelines
    </h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      Informal guidelines which may be obsolete in places and should be reviewed:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          Before committing to cvs you must submit a bug report and
          patch to the 
          <a href="http://openacs.org/bugtracker/openacs" target="_top">
            OpenACS
            bug tracker
          </a>
          . The only exceptions to this rule are
          for 
          <a href="/projects/openacs/4.7/package_inventory" target="_top">
            package
            maintainers
          </a>
          committing in a package they are
          maintaining and for members of the core team.
        </p></li><li><p>
          If you are committing a bug fix you need to coordinate
          with the package maintainer. If you are a maintainer then
          coordinate with any fellow maintainers.
        </p></li><li><p>
          If you are to commit a new feature, an architecture
          change, or a refactoring, you must coordinate with the OpenACS core
          team first. Also, such changes should have a discussion in the
          forums to allow for feedback from the whole community.
        </p></li><li><p>
          If you are changing the data model you *must* provide an
          upgrade script and bump up the version number of the
          package.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Consider any upgradability ramifications of your change.
          Avoid changing the contract and behaviour of Tcl procedures. If you
          want to build a new and clean API consider deprecating the old proc
          and making it invoke the new one.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Never rush to commit something. Before committing double
          check with cvs diff what exactly you are committing.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Always accompany a commit with a brief but informative
          comment. If your commit is related to bug number N and/or patch
          number P, indicate this in the commit comment by including &quot;bug N&quot;
          and/or &quot;patch P&quot;. This allows us to link bugs and patches in the
          Bug Tracker with changes to the source code. For example suppose
          you are committing a patch that closes a missing HTML tag, then an
          appropriate comment could be &quot;Fixing bug 321 by applying patch 134.
          Added missing h3 HTML close tag&quot;.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Commit one cohesive bug fix or feature change at a time.
          Don't put a bunch of unrelated changes into one commit.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Before you throw out or change a piece of code that you
          don't fully understand, use cvs annotate and cvs log on the file to
          see who wrote the code and why. Consider contacting the
          author.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Test your change before committing. Use the OpenACS
          package acs-automated-testing to test Tcl procedures and the tool
          
          <a href="http://tclwebtest.sourceforge.net" target="_top">
            Tclwebtest
          </a>

          to test pages
        </p></li><li><p>
          Keep code simple, adhere to conventions, and use comments
          liberally.
        </p></li><li><p>
          In general, treat the code with respect, at the same
          time, never stop questioning what you see. The code can always be
          improved, just make sure you change the code in a careful and
          systematic fashion.
