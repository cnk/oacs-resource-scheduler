# Here, we delete all the notes being fed to us, which is all 
# the notes that were checked on the index page. This page doesn't
# know/care about the fact they are the checked notes, all it knows
# is there are a bunch of template_demo_note_id values coming in 
# through the url. So, this list is sorta becoming a form too :)
#
# so this loop runs thru all passed-in values of template_demo_note_id
# and for each, deletes that note.
