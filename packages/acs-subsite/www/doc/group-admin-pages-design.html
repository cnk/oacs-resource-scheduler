<H3>II. Introduction</H3>

The group administration packages provides a "control panel" to allow
the administrator of a subsite to control the groups in use on that
subsite. Administrators manage the types of groups in use on a
subsite. For each of these group types, the administrator can create
new groups, specify applicable relationship types, create relations
between these groups, and modify attributes of the types and groups.

<H3>III. Historical Considerations</H3>

Versions 4.0.x of the ACS lacked a useful group administration package
for subsites. For example:
 
<ul>

  <li> Groups were given no context

  <li> Groups could not be deleted

  <li> Group types could not be created

  <li> Relationships were limited to membership and composition, not
  including subtypes of these two.

</ul>

This package addresses most of the short-coming of the previous
subsites group administration package making group administration
subsite aware and better integrated with the ACS Object Model.


<H3>IV. Design Tradeoffs</H3>

Whenever possible, the design of this package tries to minimize
disturbance to the core ACS 4.0 data model. Instead, we focus on
adding a more powerful user interface and PL/SQL API to the existing
group admin pages while extending the data model only when necessary. 

<H3>V. API</H3>

<h4>Permissible relationship types</h4>

We defined the following two tables to store the relationship type
used to store the permissible relationship types for group types and
individual groups. Whenever a group is created using the
<code>acs_group.new</code> function, the relationship types for the
new group are automatically copied from those allowed for its group
type.

<p>

<pre>
create table group_type_rels (
       group_rel_type_id      integer constraint gtr_group_rel_type_id_pk primary key,
       rel_type		      not null 
                              constraint gtr_rel_type_fk
                              references acs_rel_types (rel_type)
                              on delete cascade,
       group_type	      not null 
                              constraint gtr_group_type_fk
                              references acs_object_types (object_type)
                              on delete cascade,
       constraint gtr_group_rel_types_un unique (group_type, rel_type)
);


create table group_rels (
       group_rel_id           integer constraint group_rels_group_rel_id_pk primary key,
       rel_type		      not null 
                              constraint group_rels_rel_type_fk
                              references acs_rel_types (rel_type)
                              on delete cascade,
       group_id	              not null 
                              constraint group_rels_group_id_fk
                              references groups (group_id)
                              on delete cascade,
       constraint group_rels_group_rel_type_un unique (group_id, rel_type)
);

</pre>


<p><h4>Dynamic subtypes of object types</h4>

To allow administrators to create dynamic object types (e.g. subtypes
of the object types <code>group</code>, <code>membership_rel</code>,
and <code>composition_rel</code>), we provide a TCL library of
procedure that generate PL/SQL packages. For each dynamically created
object type, we:

<ul>
  <li>We create the ACS object type </li> 
  <li>We create a table to store the attributes for the new type </li> 
  <li>We create a PL/SQL package with a new function and delete procedure </li> 
</ul>

Whenever an attribute is added or deleted, a type added or removed, we
regenerate some of the PL/SQL packages, based on the type hierarchy
affected by the change.

<p>

Attributes themselves are stored using <code>type-specific</code>
storage. For each new attribute, we create a column in the table
dynamically created for the new object type.

<p>

To support the clean separation between programmer defined PL/SQL
packages and automatically generated packages, we add the
<code>dynamic_p</code> column to the <code>acs_object_types</code>
table. 

<p><pre>
acs_object_types.dynamic_p       char(1) default 'f' 
                                 constraint acs_obj_types_dynamic_p_ck
                                 check (dynamic_p in ('t', 'f'))
</pre>
<p>

<b>Note that the <code>dynamic_p</code> is still experimental and may
be removed in a future version of ACS</b>


<H3>VII. Data Model Discussion</H3>

...


<H3>VIII. User Interface</H3>

The user interface comprises entirely of administrative pages located
in the <code>/admin/</code> directory of the subsite package. 

<H3>IX. Configuration/Parameters</H3>

The revised group administration pages require no new package parameters.


<H3>X. Future Improvements/Areas of Likely Change</H3>

There are many areas for improvement to the user interface, including
tighter integration with the relational segments and constraints
packages. One major improvement would allow individual subsites to
define their own group types and relationship types, separate from any
other subsite. However, since ACS object types are not themselves
objects, it is difficult to properly scope object types.

<p>

We also may add a few additional package parameters including:

<ul>

  <li> "Create Group Types" (Boolean). Determines whether new group
  types can be created dynamically.

  <p><li> "Create Relationship Types" (Boolean). Determines whether
  new relationship types can be created dynamically.
 
</ul>

This document is primarily the result of discussions between Oumi
Mehrotra and Michael Bryzek. Bryan Quinn and Rafi Schloming provided
key insights early in the development process.
