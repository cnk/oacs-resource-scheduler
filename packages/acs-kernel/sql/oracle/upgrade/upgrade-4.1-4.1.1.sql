-- CHANGES
-- Added some views and modified one view to fix minor bugs
-- and make it possible to fix some UI issues in ACS Subsites
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- View: rc_all_constraints
--
-- Question: Given group :group_id and rel_type :rel_type . . .
--
--           What segments must a party be in 
--           if the party were to be on side :rel_side of a relation of 
--           type :rel_type to group :group_id ?
--
-- Answer:   select required_rel_segment
--           from rc_all_constraints
--           where group_id = :group_id
--             and rel_type = :rel_type
