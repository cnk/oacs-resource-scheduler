comment on column rel_segments.segment_name is '
  The user-entered name of the relational segment.
';

comment on column rel_segments.group_id is '
  The group for which this segment was created.

comment on column rel_segments.rel_type is '
  The relationship type used to define elements in this segment.

-- Though for permission checking we only really need to map parties to
-- member users, the old view included identity entries for all parties
-- in the system.  It doesn't cost all that much to maintain the extra
-- rows so we will, just in case some overly clever programmer out there
-- depends on it.

-- This represents a large amount of redundant data which is separately
-- stored in the group_element_index table.   We might want to clean this
-- up in the future but time constraints on 4.6.1 require I keep this 
-- relatively simple.  Implementing a real "subgroup_rel" would help a
-- lot by in itself reducing the number of redundant rows in the two
-- tables.

-- DRB: Unfortunately visibility semantics in PostgreSQL are very different
-- than in Oracle.  This makes it impossible to remove the duplicate
-- rows by maintaining a count column as I've done in the Oracle version
-- without requiring application code to issue explicit "lock table in
-- exclusive mode" statements.  This would kill abstraction and be very
-- error prone.  The PL/pgSQL procs can issue the locks but unfortunately
-- statements within such procs don't generate a new snapshot when executed
-- but rather work within the context of the caller.  This means locks within
-- a PL/pgSQL are too late to be of use.  Such code works perfectly in Oracle.

-- Maybe people who buy Oracle aren't as dumb as you thought!
