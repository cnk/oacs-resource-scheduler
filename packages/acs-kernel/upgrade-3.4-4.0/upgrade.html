<h2>ACS 4.0 Upgrade Process</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Because of some significant structural changes to the 4.0 data
model, the upgrade from 3.4 to 4.0 will be slightly more involved than
past upgrades. Much of this process can be automated, however it is
important that an expert on the site being upgraded becomes familiar
with the details of the upgrade process.</p>

<p>The process involves the following major steps:

<ol>
  <li>Load the 4.0 data model into a new schema.
  <li>Use the tools provided in resequence.sql on the old schema to
      guarantee that all integer primary keys occupy non overlapping
      ranges.
  <li>Use 'sqlplus -S service_name/service_password <
      user-group-types.sql' to generate a parties data model from the
      3.4 user group metadata. This should probably be checked to make
      sure there are no naming conflicts, etc.
  <li>Use core-migrate.sql to migrate data from the old schema to the
      new schema.
  <li>For each module or package in use, use
      <i>package-name</i>-migrate.sql to move data from the old schema
      to the new schema.
</ol>
</p>
