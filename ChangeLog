2008-04-03 01:38  emmar

	* packages/acs-templating/resources/forms/standard.adp: Enclosed
	  legend text in span so a style can be applied to it if needed.
	  Applied implicit association for checkbox/radio by wrapping the
	  formfield with the label tag. Don't generate empty div blocks
	  (e.g. when label is empty)

2008-04-02 07:47  emmar

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/: lang-util-procs-oracle.xql,
	  lang-util-procs-postgresql.xql: Fixed for spellcheck. We want to
	  match only the enabled languages.

	* packages/acs-subsite/: lib/user-info.adp, lib/user-info.tcl,

2008-03-29 04:18  emmar

	* packages/acs-templating/www/resources/mktree.js: Added the
	  mktree_remember global variable so scripts that use mktree can
	  decide if they want to keep the state of tree or not
	  (mktree_remember defaults to false)

2008-03-27 14:37  emmar

	* packages/acs-templating/www/resources/mktree.js: Replaced the use
	  of the non valid attribute 'remember' by checking if the node has
	  children to create/update a cookie that keeps its state

	* packages/search/tcl/search-procs.tcl: Roll back my previous
	  commit that put the last dequeue call into a default block of the
	  switch. Objects that have insert/update and delete operations in
	  the same run would never be dequeued otherwise.

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/request-processor-procs.tcl: Tracked down
	  obscure problem that has cropped up occasionally since the
	  beginning.  If AOLserver his hit with a domain name that's not
	  bound to the IP it is listening on, it tries to serve
	  /global/file-not-found but does not call registered preauth
	  filters first.  It does call registered procs, though.  This
	  results in rp_handler being called, but not rp_filter, and
	  rp_handler dies because it expects rp_filter to have set up
	  ad_conn.  My solution is to simply redirect to the URL AOLserver
	  substitutes, without the bogus domain name, which causes the file
	  not found page to be delivered to the user.  The calls I saw were
	  GET http://www.google.com to my server's IP - probably a security
	  exploit for IIS or Apache sometime in the deep past.

2008-03-13 08:35  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/security-procs.tcl: Allow files like "file
	  not found" or "server busy" to be displayed when the entire
	  server is restricted to registered users.

2008-03-12 14:26  emmar

	* packages/search/tcl/search-procs.tcl: Changed log notice to debug

2008-03-12 01:09  maltes

	*
	  packages/acs-templating/catalog/acs-templating.en_US.ISO-8859-1.xml:
	  Missing message keys, transformed as I guess they are meant.

2008-03-11 07:50  emmar

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/table-display-procs.tcl: HTML Strict cleanup

2008-03-07 15:34  emmar

	* packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/filter-procs.tcl: Added --
	  after switches in call to ad_html_text_convert to avoid errors
	  when the text to convert contains hyphens

2008-03-07 00:25  maltes

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/lang-message-procs.tcl: Made sure you can
	  pass an empty string as default and it translates into
	  translation missing. Thanks To Emma for noticing this

2008-03-05 22:57  maltes

	* packages/acs-lang/tcl/lang-message-procs.tcl: Fix Bug #3126.
	  lang::message::lookup was not adhering to a given default value
	  but just returned the message key missing string, even if there
	  was a default

2008-03-05 14:09  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/security-procs.tcl: Added /favicon.ico to
	  the magic list of URLs allowed when you restrict an entire site
	  to registered users.

2008-03-05 12:13  donb

	* packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/: content-folder-procs.tcl,
	  content-folder-procs.xql: Removed Malte's "fix" to content-folder
	  new, and emmanuelle's fix to that fix (which was fine), by
	  rolling back to the 5.3 version (which wasn't broken in the first
	  place, PG 8.1 was)

2008-03-04 13:24  donb

	* packages/acs-tcl/tcl/install-procs.tcl: Cleaned up the
	  install.xml stuff so it no longer puts random crap out in the log
	  written to the http socket.

2008-03-01 13:40  emmar

	* packages/acs-templating/tcl/head-procs.tcl: Added column to links
	  multirow to be able to order stylesheets

2008-02-29 07:04  emmar

	* packages/acs-content-repository/tcl/content-folder-procs.tcl:
	  default value of parent_id has to be the empty string in
	  content::folder::new

2008-02-13 10:31  emmar

	* packages/search/tcl/search-procs.tcl: Don't dequeue twice. Added
	  a default switch in search indexer for operation that does not
	  match update/insert nor delete
